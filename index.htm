		<h3>About Me:</h3><br/>
			<p>
				Outgoing is the first word I would use to describe myself. I enjoy experiencing and learning new things. My hobbies include modifying video game code and playing traditional fighting games competitively. I also enjoy being around friends and meeting new people. In high school, I wrestled for all four years and trained with the cross-country and football teams in the off-season. It is safe to say I am a very competitive individual. I fully believe I have the potential to do anything I set my mind to; the hardest thing for me was to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.

		<h2 style="font-weight:bold">What I Offer</h2><br/>
			<p class="p1">
				I can build webpages from scratch or edit and optimize a webpage already created. I have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and Dart for mobile application development. I also will accept projects that require use of the C languages. I am very confident in my skills; and I am capable of doing most things that require coding.
			</p><br/>
		
		<h2 style="font-weight:bold">Ultimate Goal</h2><br/>
			<p class="p1">
				I want to program and help code videogames and other software for AAA rated publishers or my own brand. There are job openings for a lot of the major companies in the videogame industry frequently posted online. I think this goal is very achievable as long as I keep up with my studying. The programming positions at big companies, such as Nintendo, usually require about four years of work experience. It should be fun trying to hone my skills until the day I am able to qualify and apply for a position.
