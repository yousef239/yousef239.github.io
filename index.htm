		<h3>About Me:</h3><br/>
			<p>Outgoing is the first word i would use to describe myself. I enjoy experiencing and learning new things. My hobbies include modifying videogames and playing traditional fighting games competitively. I also enjoy being around friends and meeting new people. In high school, I wrestled for all four years and trained with the cross-country and football teams in the off-season. It is safe to say I am a very competitive individual. I fully believe I have the potential to do anything I set my mind to; the hardest thing for me was to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.

	<h2 style="font-weight:bold">Ultimate Goal</h2><br/>
		<p class="p1">I want to program and help code videogames and other software for Nintendo. There is a twitter account created by some of the representatives at Nintendo that specifically tweets out available jobs. Most of the jobs deal with programming and coding. I think this goal is very achievable as long as I do not slack off with my studying. The programming positions at Nintendo usually require about four years of work experience. It should be fun trying to hone my skills until the day i am able to qualify and apply for the position.

	<h2 style="font-weight:bold">Things I Will Learn</h2><br/>
		<p class="p1">Website Application Development is my introduction to coding. The class started the second week of August 2018. I taught myself HTML and CSS to the point where I feel comfortable with them, but I have not taken the certification test at this point in time. My main focus is to master C and C++. After reading up on the possibilities of these coding languages, I realized they are exactly what I need to meet my goal.
