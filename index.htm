					About Me
				</h3><br/>
					<p class="p1">
						Outgoing is the first word I would use to describe myself. I enjoy experiencing and learning new things. My hobbies include modifying video game code and playing traditional fighting games competitively. I also enjoy being around friends and meeting new people. In high school, I wrestled for all four years and trained with the cross-country and football teams in the off-season. It is safe to say I am a very competitive individual. I fully believe I have the potential to do anything I set my mind to; the hardest thing for me was to figure out exactly what I wanted to do.

						What I Offer
					</h2><br/>
						<p class="p1">
							I am a certified .web developer. I have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, Julia, and Dart for mobile application development. I am looking for a career that will allow me to create software programs. I am very confident in my skills; and I am capable of doing most things that require coding.
						</p><br/>

					<h2 class="headmini">
						Ultimate Goal
					</h2><br/>
						<p class="p1">
							I want to program and create software that will strengthen my society and help other people. There are plenty of ways for me to accomplish this. I can create entertainment software (video game) with a deeper meaning behind it, or create mobile applications that are convenient for the community. I think this goal is very achievable. It should be fun trying to hone my skills until the day I am able to qualify and apply for a position.
